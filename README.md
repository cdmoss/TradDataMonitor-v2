# TradDataMonitor-v2

This is a student project resulting from a collaboration between the Medicine hat College and Trad Worm Industries. It serves to collect and store various types of data from sensors placed in a vermiculture environment and trigger alerts when the sensors report outside configurable boundaries. This second, unfinished version is meant to include a .NET Core console app for edge computing, and a .NET Core WebAPI and Blazor WASM app for configuration and monitoring. The sensors mostly are from [Phidget](https://www.phidgets.com/), with a couple exceptions coming from sparkfun that report their data through a NodeMCU wifi server.
